This is not a game development framework or API.  This is more of file/folder structure generator
for building games in [Gosu](https://libgosu.org).

The organization structure/covention of Storytime:

- Narrator: Handles all the game logic for the game
- Book: Displays entities to the window based on its current chapter
- Chapter: Organizes each game entity by showing parts at certain times
